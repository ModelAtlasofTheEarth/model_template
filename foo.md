Welcome! This is a template repository for submitting models to M@TE. 

If you have a model to submit to M@TE:

* fork this template and rename using this convention:
  * `creatorname_year_keyword`
* populate this document (`Readme.md`) with all relevant information
* information/files related to __model reproduction__ is recorded in `model_reproduction`
* information related to __model output__ data is kept in`model_data`
* files to display your model on <https://www.mate.science> are submitted in `website_files`
* submit a pull request to merge this model into M@TE

**Title**

The Role of Lithospheric-Deep Mantle Interactions on the
Style and Stress Evolution of Arc-Continent Collision

**Abstract**

Continents grow by the successive accretion of material to their
margins, mostly collision and accretion of intra-oceanic magmatic arcs. We investigate the effect of arc
buoyancy and viscosity on the mode of collision, and the effects on the margin using a computer modeling
approach. Our simulations show that upon collision, it is a small differential in density (3%) between the
colliding arc and the continental margin that dictates whether subduction continues or stops after collision. In
addition, our models show that arc buoyancy and viscosity drive lithospheric extension in the continental plate.
Also, as the subducting slab reaches a mantle discontinuity at 660 km depth, it folds and causes strain and stress
fluctuations on the margin.
