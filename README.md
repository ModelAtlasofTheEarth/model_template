**Title** |The Role of Lithospheric-Deep Mantle Interactions on the Style and Stress Evolution of Arc-Continent Collision | ...
**Abstract** | Continents grow by the successive accretion of material to their margins, mostly collision and accretion of intra-oceanic magmatic arcs. We investigate the effect of arc buoyancy and viscosity on the mode of collision, and the effects on the margin using a computer modeling approach. Our simulations show that upon collision, it is a small differential in density (3%) between the colliding arc and the continental margin that dictates whether subduction continues or stops after collision. In addition, our models show that arc buoyancy and viscosity drive lithospheric extension in the continental plate. Also, as the subducting slab reaches a mantle discontinuity at 660 km depth, it folds and causes strain and stress fluctuations on the margin.|

> **Note**
> To feature your model on our website (<https://mate.science>), we will require some images/animations and captions.
> Please add `web_files` folder, and describe these files using the following table.
> The `Purpose' field will be used to direct the content. You do not need to supply all of these, and you may supply multiple files with same purpose, in which case we can scroll images. 

File | Purpose | Caption
--- | --- | ---
`graphic_abstract.png` | visual abstract |  Schematic illustration of initial model conditions and subsequent post-collisional evolution of the two identified styles of arc-continent collision, whose dynamics are controlled by arc transference and slab-anchoring in less buoyant remnant arcs (see publication for further detail)
`model_setup.jpg` | model setup | (a) Model set up for numerical simulations based on previous research in the dynamics of accretionary continental margins (Moresi et al., 2014). It includes an oceanic subducting plate (dark yellow), an overriding plate composed by a continental (cyan) and cratonic domain (dark blue), and a ribbon of thicker crust representing a remnant = intra-oceanic arc attached to the oceanic plate (red). The upper mantle and the upper-lower mantle boundary are included to capture deep-mantle slab interactions. Orange, yellow, and dark green dots show locations where subducting plate convergence velocity, the trench-retreat velocity and the overriding plate (OP) retreat velocity were measured. The (b–e) profiles show a schematic lithospheric cross-section of the domains considered in our model set-up (see publication for further detail).
